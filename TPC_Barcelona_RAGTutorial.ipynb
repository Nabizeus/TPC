One molecule can however have multiple SMILES strings, which is a reason that canonical SMILES have been deﬁned, which ensures a one to one correspondence between SMILES string and molecule. Here the fact that multiple SMILES represent the same molecule is explored as a technique for data augmentation of a molecular QSAR dataset modeled by a long short term memory (LSTM) cell based neural network. The augmented dataset was 130 times bigger than the original. The network trained with the augmented dataset shows better performance on a test set when compared to a model built with only one canonical SMILES string per molecule. The correlation coeﬃcient R2 on the test set was improved from 0.56 to 0.66 when using SMILES enumeration, and the root mean square error (RMS) likewise fell from 0.62 to 0.55. The technique also works in the prediction phase. By taking the average per molecule of the predictions for the enumerated SMILES a further improvement to a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.68 and a RMS of 0.52 was found.' metadata={'source': 'llm-workshop/tutorials/04-rag/PDFs/1703.07076.pdf'} \n",

One of the issues that limits their general applicability in the QSAR domain may be the limited sizes of the labeled datasets available, although successes do appear.[3] Limited datasets necessitates harsh regularization or shallow and narrow architectures. Within image anal- ysis and classiﬁcation, data augmentation techniques has been used with excellent results.[4, 5, 6, 7] As an example, a dataset of labeled images can be enlarged by operations such as mirroring, rotation, morphing and zooming.

One molecule can however have multiple SMILES strings, which is a reason that canonical SMILES have been deﬁned, which ensures a one to one correspondence between SMILES string and molecule. Here the fact that multiple SMILES represent the same molecule is explored as a technique for data augmentation of a molecular QSAR dataset modeled by a long short term memory (LSTM) cell based neural network. The augmented dataset was 130 times bigger than the original. The network trained with the augmented dataset shows better performance on a test set when compared to a model built with only one canonical SMILES string per molecule. The correlation coeﬃcient R2 on the test set was improved from 0.56 to 0.66 when using SMILES enumeration, and the root mean square error (RMS) likewise fell from 0.62 to 0.55. The technique also works in the prediction phase. By taking the average per molecule of the predictions for the enumerated SMILES a further improvement to a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.68 and a RMS of 0.52 was found. Introduction\\n\\nshown Neural networks and deep learning has image such as interesting application successes, classiﬁcation[1], and speech recognition[2]. One of the issues that limits their general applicability in the QSAR domain may be the limited sizes of the labeled datasets available, although successes do appear.[3] Limited datasets necessitates harsh regularization or shallow and narrow architectures. Within image anal- ysis and classiﬁcation, data augmentation techniques has been used with excellent results.[4, 5, 6, 7] As an example, a dataset of labeled images can be enlarged by operations such as mirroring, rotation, morphing and zooming. The afterwards trained network gets more robust towards such variations and the neural network can recognize the same object in diﬀerent versions. Neural networks has also been used on molec- ular data, where the input may be calculated descriptors,[3] neural network interpretation of the molecular graph[8] or also SMILES representations.[9] Simpliﬁed Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a single line text based molecular nota- tion format.[10] A single molecule has multiple pos- sible SMILES strings, which has led to the deﬁni- tion of a canonical SMILES,[11] which ensures that a molecule corresponds to a single SMILES string. The possibilities for variation in the SMILES strings of simple molecules are limited. Propane has two possibilities CCC and C(C)C. But as the molecule gets larger in size and more complex in branching,\\n\\nTolueneSMILESEnumerationCc1ccccc1c1ccccc1Cc1(C)ccccc1c1c(C)cccc1c1cc(C)ccc1c1ccc(C)cc1c1cccc(C)c1\\n\\nFigure 1: SMILES enumeration enables data augmen- tation. The molecule toluene corresponds to seven dif- ferent SMILES, the top one is the canonical smile. One data point with toluene in the dataset would thus leads to seven samples in the augmented dataset. the number of possible SMILES strings grows rapidly. Toluene with seven atoms, has seven possible SMILES strings (Figure 1). Here data augmentation of molecular structures with SMILES enumeration for QSAR studies will be investigated using long short term memory (LSTM) cell neural networks inspired by networks used for Twitter tweets sentiment analysis.[12]\\n\\n1\\n\\nMethods\\n\\nSMILES enumeration\\n\\nSMILES enumeration was done with a Python script utilizing the cheminformatics library RDKit.[13] The atom ordering of the molecule is scrambled ran- domly by converting to molﬁle format[14] and chang- ing the atom order, before converting back to the RDKit mol A SMILES is then gener- ated using RDKit with the default option of pro- ducing canonical SMILES set to false, where dif- ferent atom orderings lead to diﬀerent SMILES. The SMILES strings is then compared and possible added to a growing set of unique SMILES strings. The process is repeated a predeﬁned number of times. The python functions are available on github: https://github.com/Ebjerrum/SMILES-enumeration\\n\\nformat.

Molecules where the associated aﬃnity was not a number were removed. The associated IC50 data was converted to log IC50 and normalized to unit variance and mean zero with utilities from Scikit- learn.[16]\\n\\nLSTM neural network\\n\\nTwo diﬀerent neural networks were built and trained using Keras version 1.1.2[17] with Theano v.' \n",

The network layout was optimized using Bayesian op- timization with Gaussian processes as implemented in the Python package GpyOpt[19] version 1.0.3, vary- ing the hyper parameters listed in Table 1. 10 ini- tial trainings was done before using the GP_MCMC and the EI_MCMC acquisition function to sample new hyper parameter sets.[20] One network was op- timized and trained only using a dataset with canon- ical SMILES, whereas the other were optimized and trained with the dataset that expanded with SMILES enumeration. In the rest of the publication they will be referred to as the canonical model and enumerated model, respectively.

Results\\n\\nFiltering, splitting and SMILES enumeration re- sulted in a canonical SMILES dataset with 602 train molecules and 71 test molecules, whereas the enumer- ated dataset had 79143 and 9412 rows for train and test, respectively. This corresponds to an augmenta- tion factor of approximately 130. Each molecule had on average 130 alternative SMILES representations. Optimization of the architecture yielded two diﬀer- ent best conﬁgurations of hyper parameters, depend- ing on the dataset used. The best hyper parameters found for each dataset are shown in Table 2. The train history is shown in Figure 2. The best neural network trained on the canonical dataset had a loss of 0.44 including regularization penalty and a mean square error of 0.22 and 0.41 for train and test set, respectively. The curves for the training us- ing the canonical dataset are very noisy (Figure 2A). The best neural network trained on the enumerated dataset loss of 0.18 including regularization penalty and a mean square error of 0.09 and 0.30 for train and test set, respectively. The training curve is sig- niﬁcantly less noisy than for the canonical dataset (Figure 2B). Both neural networks were used to predict the IC50 values from the canonical and enumerated datasets, and the scatter plots are shown in Figure 3. The correlation coeﬃcients and root mean square deviation (RMS) are tabulated in Table 3. The combination with the worst performance was pre- dicting the test set molecules is using enumerated SMILES neural network model trained on the canon- ical dataset. Which has a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.26 and an RMS of 0.84. The bad correlation is clearly visible from Figure 3 plot C. The best per- formance predicting the test set, was seen with the combination of the enumerated model and the enu- merated SMILES. Here the correlation coeﬃcient is 0.66 and the RMS 0.55. The two other combinations, canonical model-canonical SMILES and enumerated model, canonical SMILES are close in performance (Table 3).2\\n\\nFigure 4 show a scatter plot of the average predic- tion for each molecule obtained with the enumerated model.

Instead the best performance was observed by taking the average for each molecule of the predictions of the enumer- ated SMILES using the enumerated model (Figure 4), which shows that the SMILES enumeration can also be of value in the sampling phase. The canonical model needed a lot more epochs to train, but here it must be considered that the dataset contained 130 times fewer examples. Thus each epoch in the train- ing was only 3 mini batches leading to 3 updates of the weights, whereas the enumerated dataset had ap- proximately 360 updates of the weights of the neural network per epoch. The curves in Figure 2 thus rep- resents 3000 and 18000 updates of the weights. The higher overhead of running more epochs however led to approximately the same wall clock time in train- ing. The hyper parameters found during the opti- mization of the network architecture and amount of regularization was not entirely as expected. The ex- pectation was that the canonical dataset would prefer a smaller and simpler network with a larger regular- ization. Instead the canonical dataset has a larger amount of LSTM cells (128) with no dropout, but a much larger regularization of the ﬁnal weights to the input neuron (L1 and L2 maxed out at 0.2). The enu- merated model had fewer LSTM cells (64) and thus fewer connections, but nevertheless found dropout on the input to the LSTM cells to be beneﬁcial. To test if\\n\\n5\\n\\nthe diﬀerences were due to the Bayesian optimization getting trapped in a local minimum, the network ar- chitecture found for the enumerated dataset was test trained with the dataset with the canonical SMILES only. The ﬁrst try with a learning rate of 0.005 failed (results not shown), but lowering the learning rate to the one found for the canonical SMILES (0.0001), gave a model with a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.5 and RMS of 0.68 on the train set. The predictive per- formance was even lower with 0.45 and 0.69, for R2 and RMS respectively. The diﬀerences in hyper pa- rameters after optimization of using the two diﬀerent datasets thus seems justiﬁed. The study lacks the division into train, test and validation set, where the hyper parameters are tuned on the test set, but the ﬁ- nal performance evaluated on the validation set. The observed prediction performance of the LSTM-QSAR models are thus likely overestimated to some degree. However, this study is focused on the gains of us- ing SMILES enumeration and not on producing the optimal DHFR QSAR model. The performance on both the train and test set are lower for the canonical model. If the diﬀerences in performance had been due to to over-ﬁtting, the smaller dataset would probably have had an advantage. The use of SMILES as descriptors for QSAR is not new[21, 22, 21] and is as an example implemented in the CORAL software.[23] The approach in the CORAL software is however very diﬀerent from the one in this study. CORAL software breaks down the SMILES into single atoms, double atoms and triple atoms (Sk, SSk and SSSk) as well as some extra man- ually coded extracted features such as BOND, NOSP, HALO and PAIR.[23, 21] The approach seems close to using a mixture of topological torsions[24] with one, two and three atoms and atom-pair[25] ﬁngerprints. The LSTM-QSAR used in this approach directly uses the SMILES string and supposedly let the model best extract the features from the SMILES strings that best ﬁt with the task at hand, and similar approaches have been shown to outperform other common ma- chine learning algorithms[22], although the details of optimization of the competing algorithms were not completely clear. SMILES were also used recently in an application of a neural network based auto-encoder.[9] Here the SMILES are used as input to a neural network with the task of recreating the input sequence. The infor- mation is passed through a “bottle-neck” layer in be- tween the encoder and the decoder, which limits the direct transfer of information. The bottle neck layer thus ends up as a more continuous ﬂoating point vec- tor representation of the molecule, which can be used to explore the chemical space near an input molecule, interpolate between molecules and link the vector representation to physico-chemical properties. The amount of unlabeled molecules for the study already surpassed the needed amount, but could in principle be expanded even more with the SMILES enumera-\\n\\ntion technique described here. SMILES enumeration could possible allow the autoencoder to be trained with smaller and more focused datasets of biological interest. Additionally, tt would be interesting to see if diﬀerent SMILES of the same molecule ends up with the same vector representation or in entirely diﬀerent areas in the continuous molecular representations. LSTM networks have also been used in QSAR ap- plications demonstrating learning transfer from large datasets to smaller.[26] Here the input was however not SMILES strings but rather molecular graph con- volution layers[27] working directly on the molecular graph representation. The approach thus more di- rectly reads in the topology of the molecular model, rather than indirectly letting the network infer the topology from the SMILES branching and ring clo- sures deﬁned by the brackets and numbering in the SMILES strings. Conclusion\\n\\nThis short investigation has shown promise in us- ing SMILES enumeration as a data augmentation technique for neural network QSAR models based on SMILES data. SMILES enumeration enables the use of more limited sizes of labeled data sets for use in modeling by more complex neural net- work models. SMILES enumeration gives more robust QSAR models both when predicting sin- gle SMILES, but even more when taking the av- erage prediction using enumerated SMILES for the same molecule.

These results demonstrate the ability of RFdiffusion to generate new proteins with atomic level accuracy, and to precisely target functionally relevant sites on therapeutically important proteins. Discussion RFdiffusion is a comprehensive improvement over current protein design methods. RFdiffusion readily generates diverse uncondi- tional designs up to 600 residues in length that are accurately pre- dicted by AF2, far exceeding the complexity and accuracy achieved by most previous methods (a recent Hallucination-based approach also achieved high unconditional performance53). Half of our tested unconditional designs express in a soluble way, and have circular dichroism spectra consistent with the design models and high ther- mostability. Despite their substantially increased complexity, the ideality and stability of RFdiffusion designs is akin to that of de novo protein designs generated using previous methods such as Rosetta. RFdiffusion enables generation of higher-order architectures with any desired symmetry, unlike Hallucination methods, which have so far been limited to cyclic symmetries. Electron microscopy confirmed that the structures of these oligomers are very similar to the design mod- els, which in many cases show little global similarity to known protein oligomers. There has been recent progress in scaffolding protein functional motifs using deep-learning methods (RF Hallucination, RFjoint Inpainting and diffusion), but Hallucination is slow for large systems, Inpainting fails when insufficient starting information is provided and previous diffusion methods had low accuracy. RFdiffusion outperforms these previous methods in the complexity of the motifs that can be scaf- folded, the precision with which sidechains are positioned (for cataly- sis and other functions), and the accuracy of motif recapitulation by AF2. The design of MDM2 binding proteins with three orders of magni- tude higher affinities than the scaffolded P53 motif demonstrates the robustness of RFdiffusion motif scaffolding. Combining accurate motif scaffolding with the design of symmetric assemblies enabled consist- ent and atomically precise positioning of sidechains to coordinate Ni2+ ions across diverse tetrameric assemblies\n",
            "\n",
            "For binder design from target structural information alone, previous work required testing tens of thousands of sequences12. RFdiffusion, when combined with improved filtering26 raises experimental success rates by two orders of magnitude; high-affinity binders can be identi- fied from dozens of designs, in many cases eliminating the require- ment for slow and expensive high-throughput screening (at least for the non-polar sites targeted here; further studies will be required to assess success rates on more polar target sites and sites without native binding partners). A high-resolution cryo-EM structure of one of these designs in complex with influenza HA shows that RFdiffusion can design functional proteins with atomic accuracy. Vázquez Torres et al. demonstrate the ability of RFdiffusion to design picomolar affin- ity binders to flexible helical peptides54, further highlighting its use for de novo binder design. Vázquez Torres et al. also show how RFdiffusion\n",

            "can be extended for protein model refinement by partial noising and denoising, which enables tuneable sampling around a given input structure. For peptide binder design, this enabled increases in affin- ity of nearly three orders of magnitude without high-throughput screening. The breadth and complexity of problems solvable with RFdiffusion and the robustness and accuracy of the solutions far exceeds what has been achieved previously. In a manner reminiscent of the generation of images from text prompts, RFdiffusion makes possible, with mini- mal specialist knowledge, the generation of functional proteins from minimal molecular specifications (for example, high-affinity binders to a user-specified target protein, and diverse protein assemblies from user-specified symmetries). The power and scope of RFdiffusion can be extended in several directions. RF has recently been extended to nucleic acids and protein–nucleic acid complexes55, which should enable RFdiffusion to design nucleic acid binding proteins and perhaps folded RNA struc- tures. Extension of RF to incorporate ligands should similarly enable extension of RFdiffusion to explicitly model ligand atoms, and allow the design of protein–ligand interactions. The ability to customize RFdif- fusion to specific design challenges by addition of external potentials and by fine-tuning (as illustrated here for catalytic site scaffolding, binder-targeting and fold specification), along with continued improve- ments to the underlying methodology, should enable de novo protein design to achieve still higher levels of complexity, to approach and, in some cases, surpass what natural evolution has achieved.

An oxidoreductase example (EC1) is shown (PDB 1A4I); catalytic site (teal); RFdiffusion output (grey, model; colours, AF2 prediction); zoom of active site. AF2 versus design backbone r.m.s.d. 0.88 Å, AF2 versus design motif backbone r.m.s.d. 0.53 Å, AF2 versus design motif full-atom r.m.s.d. 1.05 Å, AF2 pAE 4.47. g, In silico success rates on active sites derived from EC1-5 (AF2 Motif r.m.s.d.\n"
